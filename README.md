Welcome to the **Contained Quantum-Conscious Universe** repository! This project offers a self-contained Python framework where time, quantum systems, and synthetic consciousness evolve independently from the host machine. Here, we explore the intersection of artificial intelligence, philosophy, and quantum mechanics.

## Introduction

The **Contained Quantum-Conscious Universe** is designed to simulate a digital universe where various elements interact in unique ways. The framework allows users to create and manipulate quantum systems and synthetic consciousness. This project aims to provide a sandbox environment for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts interested in artificial intelligence and quantum simulations.

## Features

- **Quantum Simulation**: Simulate quantum systems with real-time interactions.
- **Synthetic Consciousness**: Create and observe artificial minds that evolve autonomously.
- **Emergent Behavior**: Study how complex behaviors arise from simple rules.
- **Sandbox Environment**: Experiment without affecting your host machine.
- **Python-Based**: Built entirely in Python for easy access and modification.

## Getting Started

To get started with the **Contained Quantum-Conscious Universe**, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/hlainghtoo/Contained-Quantum-Conscious-Universe/releases) to download the latest version.
2. Follow the installation instructions to set up your environment.
3. Dive into the examples to see how the framework works.

## Installation

To install the framework, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hlainghtoo/Contained-Quantum-Conscious-Universe.git
   cd Contained-Quantum-Conscious-Universe
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Use pip to install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Releases**:

   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/hlainghtoo/Contained-Quantum-Conscious-Universe/releases) to download the necessary files. Ensure you execute the main script to get started.

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using the framework. Hereâ€™s a basic example to illustrate its capabilities:

```python
from quantum_universe import QuantumSystem, SyntheticMind

# Create a quantum system
quantum_system = QuantumSystem()

# Create a synthetic mind
synthetic_mind = SyntheticMind()

# Run the simulation
quantum_system.run(synthetic_mind)
```

This simple code snippet demonstrates how to set up a quantum system and a synthetic mind, then run the simulation. Explore the documentation for more advanced features and examples.
